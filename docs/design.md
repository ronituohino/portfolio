# General design goals

I feel like I want to tell my story with my portfolio, but I don't want to force
the user to see it: "ugh, just take me to your projects, I don't care about the
stuff you did 5 years ago lol"

I want the portfolio to have a cartoonish, hand-drawn, notebook feel with lots
of custom assets.

I also want to maintain responsiveness, so people can view the site well on
mobile also. Accessibility is also a priority.

# Title

I want my name to pop up with a smooth animation, and my story to be presented
with hand-drawn icons that pop up sequentially forming a sort of path. This path
will also function as a hint to the user, that the site can be scrolled down to
see my projects and contact stuff.

Path:

- Starts near my name
- First group shows my interest to gaming along with introduction to programming
  (Controller, Minecraft, Minecraft redstone, Destiny)
- Second group shows first programming languages and projects (Python, Unity C#)
- Third group shows transition over to military & university (University, Disco,
  Camo, Gym)
- Fourth group shows interest in web dev (React, TS, Docker, Postgres, Node)

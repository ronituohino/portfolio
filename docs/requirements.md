# Application requirements

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to serve as a portfolio and blogging website.
It consists of these main sections:

- About
- Projects
- Contact (Freelancing & Consulting)
- Blog

## Users

The application does not require a user system.

## UI

The UI consists of 3 web pages:

- Home / Portfolio (About, Projects, Contact)
- Blog browser
- Blog page

The portfolio page is static and displays information about me.

The first section the user is greeted with is the About section. Here I can have
some cool animations and effects with my name and title

The projects section displays a list of my previous projects and some
information about them. Here I can also include some references and companies
I've worked in.

The contacts section has some channels which the user can contact me. It also
displays info that I do freelancing & consulting.

Blog browser displays a grid of blogs with thumbnails and titles. Blogs are
coded into the app itself, so I have full freedom to put any kind of content I
wish on there. Blogs can be liked by anonymous users. There is a views counter
on each blog post.
